The backend can be run for local testing by loading a 
new docker-compose workspace provided by the projectdivar 
git repository.

once loaded, you can seed the database using the seed files
from the ngsplanner_backend repository. You can use the locally
created .docker_terminal command to access the terminal of the
projectdivar_postgres_1 instance. Finally, you need to
add a .env file for your environment that includes:

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://4501-scarlet-echidna-bpwfvar6.ws-us11.gitpod.io/ngsplanner

Replacing the URL with the URL that points to the /server docker
hosted backend.
